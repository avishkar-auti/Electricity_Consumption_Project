## Energy Consumption Monitoring and Visualization

With the increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions, optimizing household electricity consumption has become a crucial area of focus. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and optimize electricity usage patterns in households. By predicting consumption trends and identifying potential areas for savings, this project aims to reduce energy costs and promote more efficient use of electricity.

This repository contains the complete workflow for this project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, as well as exploratory data analysis and visualization. The primary goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast electricity consumption and provide actionable insights for optimizing energy usage.

Key components of the project include:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.
- **Model Training:** Implementing and training machine learning models to predict electricity consumption.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using various metrics.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Fault Detection:** Using rolling Z-scores to identify faulty devices that consume abnormal amounts of electricity.

## Notebooks

- **Electricity Savings Estimation.ipynb**: This notebook contains the analysis and estimation of potential electricity savings using machine learning techniques.
- **Rolling Z-Score for Faulty Devices.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on identifying faulty devices using rolling Z-scores.

## Scripts

- **tsp.py**: Contains the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) related code which might be used for optimizing routes in electricity distribution.
- **tempCodeRunnerFile.py**: Temporary code runner file, which may contain snippets or auxiliary functions used during development.
